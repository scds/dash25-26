# Microdata Analysis with Python using Statistics Canada Data

Want to learn how to work with rich Canadian survey data? The Public Use Microdata File (PUMF) from Statistics Canada offers detailed microdata from national sample surveys—perfect for uncovering meaningful insights.

In this hands-on workshop, you’ll learn how to access, manage, and analyze PUMF datasets. Through practical exercises, you’ll explore statistical techniques and develop skills to interpret and present your findings effectively.

By the end of this session, participants will be able to:

Access and navigate Statistics Canada’s PUMF datasets

Manage microdata for analysis using common tools

Apply basic statistical methods to extract insights

Interpret and communicate results from survey data

This workshop is ideal for students, faculty, staff, and community members interested in exploring national data.

## Workshop Preparation 

McMaster participants will use their MacID to login to McMaster's Jupiter Notebook instance. Non-McMaster participants must have a tool (such as Google Colab, Kaggle Notebooks, PyCharm, Spyder etc.) ready on their system to write Python code.

## Facilitator Bio

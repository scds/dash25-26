# Introduction to R Programming (Winter Term)

Curious about R but not sure where to start? This beginner-friendly workshop is designed for those with no prior experience in R programming. You’ll get hands-on with RStudio, explore key data types and data structures, and learn how to perform basic data manipulation. By the end, you’ll be able to write and run your own R scripts with confidence.

This session will take place synchronously and will be recorded and shared publicly for future reference.

In the workshop, participants will learn to:
- Navigate the RStudio environment
- Understand and use basic data types and structures in R
- Write and run simple R scripts
- Perform basic data manipulation tasks

Whether you're working with data in the sciences, humanities, or social sciences, this workshop offers a strong foundation to begin your R programming journey.

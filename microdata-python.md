# Microdata Analysis with Python using Statistics Canada Data

This hands-on workshop will guide participants through the process of data analysis using the Public Use Microdata File (PUMF) from Statistics Canada’s sample surveys. You will learn how to access, manage, and analyze microdata to extract meaningful insights. Participants will engage with sample datasets, explore various statistical techniques, and gain practical experience in interpreting and presenting their findings. Whether you're a student, researcher, or professional, this workshop will equip you with the tools to effectively analyze and utilize Canadian survey data.

## Workshop Preparation 

McMaster participants will use their MacID to login to McMaster's Jupiter Notebook instance. Non-McMaster participants must have a tool (such as Google Colab, Kaggle Notebooks, PyCharm, Spyder etc.) ready on their system to write Python code.
